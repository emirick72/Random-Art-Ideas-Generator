# Random-Art-Ideas-Generator
This is a personal project idea I have. I wanted to make a program where I could input all the art ideas I have and then randomly cycle through the list and pick one when I want to make art.

This project is also being tracked in a Notion Board.

* The user should be able to input an infinite number of ideas (as strings) and they will be put into an array. Account for possible ideas being multiple sentences long, like paragraphs.
* After inputting some ideas, the user should be able to press a button to cycle through their inputted ideas and press another button to finalize their decision. (Maybe add a third button if they want to delete their finalized decision and start again?)
* If the user inputs the same idea twice, then have a message pop up and say that that idea is already in the list. (How would this work with different English phrases for the same idea?)
* Make a desktop/PC and/or a mobile-friendly version (has to be accessed via a browser possibly?)
